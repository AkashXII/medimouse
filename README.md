MediMouse:
MediMouse is a simple full-stack project I built while learning FastAPI and Vanilla JavaScript.
Just a hands-on way i used to practice API building, database handling, and frontend integration.
What it Does
Lets users sign up and log in
Allows basic medicine tracking (add, edit, delete, view)
Calculates and displays BMI
What I Learned
Setting up a backend with FastAPI
Designing and consuming REST APIs
Handling data with SQLAlchemy ORM
Basic password hashing with bcrypt
Connecting a backend to a simple JavaScript frontend
DOM manipulation for dynamic UI updates
Note
This is purely a learning project to explore how backend and frontend can work together.
