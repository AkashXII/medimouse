MediMouse:<br>
MediMouse is a simple full-stack project I built while learning FastAPI and Vanilla JavaScript.
Just a hands-on way i used to practice API building, database handling, and frontend integration.<br>
What it Does
Lets users sign up and log in
Allows basic medicine tracking (add, edit, delete, view)
Calculates and displays BMI<br>
What I Learned
Setting up a backend with FastAPI
Designing and consuming REST APIs
Handling data with SQLAlchemy ORM
Basic password hashing with bcrypt
Connecting a backend to a simple JavaScript frontend
DOM manipulation for dynamic UI updates<br>
Note
This is purely a learning project to explore how backend and frontend can work together.
